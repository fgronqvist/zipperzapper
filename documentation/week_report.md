#Weekly report

Things done week 1

* Project creation
* Github repo and version control added to the project
* Settling on creating a compression/de-compression program
* Some research on different algorithms and settling on LZW
* Documenting stuff
* Labtool registration

Things done week 2

* Application structure
* Application library work with Java.Util.Zip package. My first couple of attempts using java.util.deflate/inflate resulted in "garbled" deflated files when the inputfile was over the buffer size. I just could not get the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream to create a deflated file that was identical to the inflated one. These never made it into the repo.
* Documentation

Things done week 3

* Own HashMap implementation added.
* Zipper compression added but not working as expected.
* Unit tests expanded.
* Documentation
